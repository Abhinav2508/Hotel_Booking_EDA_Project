# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis & Insights using Python

This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data, uncovering trends, patterns, and insights related to customer behavior and cancellations. The aim is to help hotel management improve their booking strategies, reduce cancellations, and boost customer satisfaction.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Understand guest booking patterns and cancellation behavior.
- Identify key factors that influence booking cancellations.
- Provide actionable insights to improve hotel operations and profitability.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *NumPy, **Pandas* – data manipulation
- *Matplotlib, **Seaborn* – data visualization
- *Google Colab* – coding environment
- *GitHub* – version control and project hosting

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes bookings from *City Hotel* and *Resort Hotel*, along with details such as:
- Booking dates
- Hotel type
- Lead time
- Room types
- Number of guests
- Special requests
- Booking status (canceled or not)
- Distribution channel
- Country, deposit type, market segment, etc.

---

## 📊 Data Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- Converted date formats and mapped months to numbers
- Created derived columns like total_nights, total_stay, room_match
- Reset index and cleaned unnecessary data

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (15+ Charts)
- Booking cancellation counts
- Hotel type vs cancellation rate
- ADR (Average Daily Rate) by month
- Lead time vs cancellations (boxplot and KDE)
- Impact of special requests
- Country-wise cancellations
- Deposit type and cancellation rates (pie chart)
- Stay duration distribution
- Correlation heatmap
- Room mismatch analysis
- Market segment insights
- Scatter plots for ADR vs lead time, etc.

### 3. Key Insights
- City hotels have higher cancellation rates than resort hotels
- Longer lead times correlate with more cancellations
- Guests with special requests cancel less frequently
- Mismatches between reserved and assigned rooms are common
- Non-refundable bookings still show notable cancellations (needs review)

### 4. Business Recommendations
- Monitor long lead time bookings; offer incentives or confirmations
- Improve room allocation system to match reservations
- Use loyalty programs or reminders to reduce cancellations
- Focus on reliable market segments and countries with low cancellation rates

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Data preprocessing and wrangling
- EDA and feature extraction
- Aggregation, grouping, and sorting
- Data visualization (bar, line, pie, scatter, heatmap, KDE)
- Business storytelling with data
- Derived feature creation for deeper insights

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding hotel booking dynamics through EDA. The insights can guide better decision-making and operational improvements in the hotel industry.
